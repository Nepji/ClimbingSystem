# Climbing System – Unreal Engine 5 (C++)


A modular and responsive **Climbing System** built with **Unreal Engine 5** using **pure C++** and enhanced with **Control Rig** for high-quality animation control. This system enables realistic climbing mechanics including ledge grabbing, vaulting, hanging, and directional strafing.

Designed for third-person adventure, platformer, and action games — it integrates seamlessly into existing character systems and environments.
